= FAQ =

Q: How do you set featured posts?
A: Use sticky posts: http://codex.wordpress.org/Sticky_Posts or use the Jetpack plugin along with its Featured Content module: http://jetpack.me/support/featured-content/

Q: How do you get the four featured posts in columns horizontally?
A: Featured posts is set to do that automatically. If you see your featured posts vertically, it's probably because your screen is fairly narrow, and since Expound is responsive, it adapts to fit the content.

Q: Can I remove the sidebar?
A: Yes. You can create a new page and pick the full-width page template. Or if you prefer to remove the sidebar from all pages, simply remove all widgets from the sidebar in Appearance - Widgets.
